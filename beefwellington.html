<p><strong>Beef Wellington is a steak dish of English origin, made out of fillet steak coated with pâté and duxelles, wrapped in puff pastry, then baked.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Some recipes include wrapping the coated meat in a crêpe or parma ham to retain the moisture and prevent it from making the pastry soggy.</strong></p>

<p>This Beef Wellington recipe is the best! Beef tenderloin fillet is coated with mustard, mushroom duxelles, ham, and then wrapped in a puff pastry and baked.</p>

<div class="ingredients">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound beef tenderloin filet</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound mushroom</li>
            <li>4 thin slice ham</li>
            <li>2 tbsp yellow mustard</li>
            <li>1 puff pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>2 large egg yolks, beaten</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p><h3>Preheat the oven</h3></p>
    <p>Allow the oven to preheat to 400°F as you assemble the Wellington.</p></li>
    
    <li><p><h3>Sear the fillet</h3></p>
    <p>Season the fillet generously with salt and pepper. Heat a tablespoon or two of oil in a large pan on high heat. Sear the fillet in the pan on all sides until well browned.</p></li>
    
    <li><p><h3>Brush the filet with mustard</h3></p>
    <p>Remove the filet from the pan and let cool. Once cooled, brush the fillet on all sides with mustard.</p></li>   

    <li><p><h3>Prepare the mushroom duxelles</h3></p>
    <p>Chop the mushrooms and put them into a food processor and purée. Heat the sauté pan on medium high heat.</p> 
    <p>Transfer the mushroom purée into the pan and cook, allowing the mushrooms to release their moisture.
    When the moisture released by the mushrooms has boiled away, remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside to cool.</p></li>

    <li><p><h3>Wrap the filet in mushroom paste and ham</h3></p>
    <p>Roll out a large piece of plastic wrap. Lay out the slices of ham on the plastic wrap so that they overlap. Spread the mushroom mixture over the ham.</p>
    <p>Place the beef filet in the middle, roll the mushroom and ham over the fillet, using the plastic wrap so that you do this tightly.</p></li>

    <li><p><h3>Roll out the puff pastry and wrap the beef filet</h3></p>
    <p>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry sheet to a size that will wrap around the beef fillet. Unwrap the fillet from the plastic wrap and place in the middle of the pastry dough. Brush the edges of the pastry with the beaten egg yolks.</p></li>
    <p>Fold the pastry around the fillet, cutting off any excess at the ends. (Pastry that is more than 2 layers thick will not cook all the way, try to limit the overlap.)
        Place on a small plate, seam side down, and brush beaten egg yolks all over the top. Chill for 5 to 10 minutes.</p>   

    <li><p><h3>Brush with the egg wash and score</h3></p>
    <p>Place the pastry-wrapped fillet on a baking pan. Brush the exposed surface again with beaten eggs. Score the top of the pastry with a sharp knife, not going all the way through the pastry. Sprinkle the top with coarse salt.

    </p></li>

    <li><p><h3>Bake in oven</h3></p>
    <p>Bake at 400°F for 25 to 35 minutes. The pastry should be nicely golden when done. To ensure that your roast is medium rare, test with an instant read meat thermometer. Pull out at 125 to 130°F for medium rare.
