<p><strong>Here’s how we make it in our kitchen. Making whole roasted chicken at home is simple and something you should know how to do.</strong></p>

<p>How to perfectly roast a whole chicken with aromatic lemon and garlic. With our easy recipe, the chicken stays juicy and becomes ultra-flavorful.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 whole chicken, patted dry</li>
    <li>Salt and fresh ground pepper</li>
    <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chicken stock or water</li>
    <li>1 lemon, quartered</li>
    <li>1 whole headg garlic, halved crosswise</li>
    <li>Small bunch fresh herbs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>Generously season the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper. If you have time, refrigerate the chicken, uncovered, for an hour, or overnight.</p></li>
    <li><p>Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Scatter onions in the bottom of a roasting pan and cover them with the stock (or water). Place chicken breast-side up on top of the onions.</p> 
    <p>Stuff the cavity with halved garlic, lemon wedges, and herbs. Use kitchen twine to tie the legs together. (If you don’t have twine, leave the legs as they are.)</p></li>
    <li><p>Roast the chicken for 1 hour, then spoon pan juices over the chicken several times and cook another 20 to 30 minutes longer.</p> 
    <p>You will know the chicken is done when an internal thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees F or when the chicken juices run clear when when you cut between a leg and a thigh.</p> 
    <p>Depending on the size of your chicken, the total roasting time may vary.</p></li>
